Having had extensive experiences in entrepreneurship through basic website building, student & graduate employee supervision, hiring processes, clientele acquisition & support, & so much more, I continue to gravitate towards growth opportunities. From founding and growing a tutoring company, Students2Students4U, I also acquired an equity holder position at 22% with a college applications technology company, Froshbite. 

        
<br><br>


Students2Students4U is an online initiative was founded and run by my 17 year old high school self during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to bridge the gap in education with access and affordability in mind. As founder, I tutor 7 days a week, hire and manage a student staff (CFO, PR Manager, Executive Secretary, Content Creation Officers, Outreach Correspondents, & Tutors), create and run a website, social media, and work with student/parent services. I firmly believe that no student should be disadvantaged by their circumstance, and in saying so, should be presented an equal opportunity to succeed and thrive in any given academic environment be it in person or distance learning. In having the pleasure of providing support to students from numerous different walks of life, I hope to utilize business as a means of changing the way people learn by giving them support from a peer who has experience in succeeding in those areas of study. In other words, my team speaks student. From students to students I maintain Students2Students4Uâ€™s purpose in growing with students while supporting them in their academic journey! Students2Students4U's mission is to provide educational equity in supporting students from all walks of life, by employing successful and proven college students to provide quality academic support from one successful peer to another. In other words, we speak student. From students to students we hope to grow with you and your child while supporting them in their academic journey!

Froshbite was founded by a software engineer based in Southern California and marketed by a Finance degree expert. With the need to improve their siteâ€™s structure, quality, growth, reach, and results, they approached me with 22% of Froshbite in trade for my business expertise within the educational industry, along with my capacity to be a team player while effectively spearheading the growth of the company through extensive leadership.
